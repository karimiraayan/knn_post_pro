# PROGRAM
##

.cpp files are stored in sources/ 
.h files are stored in includes/


main.cpp includes 
    main-function (c-style returns int...)
    #include simulator headers
    calls vpro functions (-> from simulator headers)
    performs maybe the verification of vpro's execution 
        (e.g. in a check funuction with some reference code)
        
includes/defines.h
    sets defines for execution of different functions 
    constants..

includes/helper.h  & sources/helper.cpp
    some helper functions, like print of a progressbar/print int as bit




##
# Simulator Init/Exit
##

init/init.sh
    script called to convert input data, etc. (e.g. creation of a binary input file from image)

init/input.cfg
    data loaded into MM by simulator (before start of void main(), the simulator init uses this configuration file to initialize specific MM regions with content)

exit/exit.sh
    script called to convert output data, etc. (e.g. postprocessing/visualization/verify)

exit/output.cfg
    data stored from MM by simulator (after simulator return, regions of the MM can be written out into binary files, e.g. for postprocessing/...)

# MISC
##

CmakeLists.txt (always copied from ../ref_cmakelists.txt by Makefile) => DO NOT EDIT
CmakeListsAdd.txt 
    modifications for this programm => feel free to edit
Makefile
    settings for HW configuration. Used to compile and execute programm

data/
    folder for input/output files (used by input.cfg/output.cfg scripts)

lib/
    folder to store external libs (.so)
    used in CMakeList to link against
    librarys to compile agains can be placed under /lib (e.g. library for a reference implementation using tensorflow...)

scripts/
    folder with scripts for parallel compile/run to evaluate different HW configurations
    should use /localtemp to avoid data traffic on current mounted folder
